## 8. 📋 Minor Observations

### Non-Critical Items:
1. **Duplicate edinburgh route** - Both `/examples/edinburgh-wildlife-haven` (static) and `/examples/edinburgh-scottish-wildlife-haven` (dynamic) exist. Not breaking, but could be consolidated.
2. **Filter labels** - Some filter values map to abbreviated codes ('wildlife' vs display 'Wildlife/Naturalistic'). Works correctly but could be more explicit.
3. **Gallery images** - Most plans have empty `galleryImages` arrays. Could be populated with additional AI-generated views.

### Suggested Enhancements (Future):
- Add comparison feature (side-by-side plans)
- Implement plant swap functionality (currently disabled)
- Generate missing gallery images (2-3 per plan)
- Add PDF download for example plans
- Populate remaining 70 plans to reach 84 target coverage
